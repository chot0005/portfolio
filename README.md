In my design, I'd like to make slight layout adjustments to align with the latest content I've added.

The challenge of this project was to integrate both Bootstrap framework and another framework, necessitated by conflicts between their classes. As a solution, I utilized the alternative framework in specific areas such as list in about page, video embedding and toggle menu functionality.

Most of the images are from my own projects. This is the list of stock images I used.
